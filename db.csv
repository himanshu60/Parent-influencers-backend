"I have two daughters. One is 8 years and other is 3.5 years old.\nElder one is little becoming inferior. She afraid of to asking questions. She is afraid that she will be scolded if she asks questions. That‚Äôs why she doesn‚Äôt ask questions. Whether it‚Äôs studies or other things. We are also at mistake as parents. What should I do? She can‚Äôt talk to anyone without fear. ","You can try 3 things:\n1. Asking child why she is not asking questions? She could say that she did ask in the school but teacher scolded back. Whatever she says, you may listen. It is possible that she says no because she is scared. \n2. Then you may say her that you can ask any question to mommy. Mom will not scold her. Even if you did in the past, it will not repeat. This way, your daughter will have one person to whom she can ask questions. \n3. Check the school once whether they allow students to ask questions or not."

"Please give me some point how parents can improve there behaviour with there kids so that they can have friendly relation with them and how a mother can control her anger. Or any suggestions if someone have already a bit complicated relation with there kid. I have to work on my anger in many situations i controlled it but yes there were situation that it got bursted on my son. Which I feel was not correct.","It is so good that you recognise that it is your anger and nothing that your son is doing. "
"He is getting from other family members because I live in joint family and no one understands what i am trying to say. Or make them understand about child behaviour ( comments like tu toh dheet hai kitna ziddi hota ja hai maa n bigad diya hai etc many) problem arises when my husband doesn't understand the same. There is chapter of your where u mentioned parents busy hai bacha unke liye drink banane gaya and the parent reaction was exactly my husband reaction. There is lot straight forward parenting is going on with ruhaan and the word \"NO\" is used hell lot of time almost a whole day.","you are trying and you care.

"Thoughts on parents and their previous trauma and its impact on children‚Äôs growth. We all know it hampers, so more than how I would like to understand how parents can avoid bringing their patterns and traumas while raising their children.","Being with children is a chance to heal ourselves, if one can be conscious"
"My daughter is 19 mnths. But jab usko me koi chij nai deti hu ya uski koi zid Puri nai kti hu tou wo mujhe hit karti haiShe is just 19 mnths..how can I control this behaviourYa kabhi kabhi wo masti me b mujhe hit kar deti hai.\n\nI tell her hitting noo..nd wo khud b bolti hai hitting nooo..but not regularly..but spcly wen i don't listen to her","Meherr ji - sorry for the late reply. Aapki beti choti hai. Is umar mein kuch na milne pe kaise behave karna hai bachon ko pata nahin hota. Emotion pe kaabu nahin hota. Lekin bachon ka bhi maarna rok sakte hai. Thoda time laga ke.\nKabhi bhi jiss cheez ke liye bacha hit kar raha hai woh puri nahin karni kyonki phir bachey ko lagta hai ke maarne se cheez milegi. So a no means a no. But pyaar se.\nAap calm aawaaz mein usko bol sakti hai - No using hands and feet. Mujhe lagti hai. Same line hi humein baar baar use karni hai.\nPhir Aap uski feeling ko acknowledge karo. Ke aapko woh chahiye. Haan? Mujhe pata hai. Mujhe pata hai aapko aacha lagta hai. Lekin maarne se kabhi nahin milega. Mummy loves you. \nBachon ke nervous system ko touch karne se calmnes milti hai. Unko touch karke pyaar se mana karenge to baat samajne ka chance zyada hai.\nYeh sab karke hum apne bachey ko sikha rahe hai ke how to be in control of their emotions. Yeh imp learning sabse pehle maa baap se hi aati hai :-)\nLots of love to your family <heart symbol>"
"So the thing is, I‚Äôve a 1 year old. When he was hit by something or got hurt or when he falls down, immediately my family members start hitting that object so that he calms down. I‚Äôm not liking this behaviour. They are failing to understand a point that eventually he starts blaming someone else or something else if anything goes wrong instead of regulating his emotions. No matter how many times I try to express this to my family members, they brush it off and say that they‚Äôll learn slowly when they get biggerüòê","Try this - rather than advising. Ask them questions to chat up, don‚Äôt go with a closed mind. For eg why do you hit the other thing, where did you learn this from"
"How I can make my child wake up early to school. She just wakes up at 7 am where her school is for 8. And top of that she is a picky eater. Needs atleast 40 min of time for breakfast itself. I start waking her up from 6. This is becoming our daily thing. I'm helpless and showing frustration on her. I want to change this situation. What can I do","i faced similar thing with my daughter. We did couple of things\n- slept on time the previous day\n- spoke to our daughter that we need to leave for school at X time. And before that she has to\n- get ready\n- eat food\n\nAfter that, my daughter completely changed. She does needs some reminder. But 90% is gone because she knows that if she doesn‚Äôt get ready and her school has a cut off time of 8.45am. And if she doesn‚Äôt get school on time, she will have to spend a day at home when all her friends will be at school. So actually, there is sense of agency.
