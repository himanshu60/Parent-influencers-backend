But 90% is gone because she knows that if she doesn‚Äôt get ready and her school has a cut off time of 8.45am. And if she doesn‚Äôt get school on time, she will have to spend a day at home when all her friends will be at school. So actually, there is sense of agency. And this is what we need to activate in every child. Their own sense of agency to do things. We can‚Äôt keep pushing them. Then the sense of agency goes away. So you need to take a step back and let the child be responsible."}

You could explore them as well.\n\nWhen the same kid becomes 14-15 years old, stop listening to his parents and only does what his friends do. So parents tell him you only do what your friends are telling. Can‚Äôt you think for your ownself.\n\nAnd now when your child is younger. when he is different and we think why is he different and not like other kids.

If you have it when you go to drop her, she will sense it. So imp for you to be calm- say you are leaving from your house for school and she says mumma i dont want to go, starts to cry a bit and to keep her calm you say we are not going to school but then you do go to school, she starts crying again. So our lying is contributing to her crying. We should 100% stop lying.It is imp to see that the school has the right environment for the child. That means - place to play, free play, to run around, loving teachers. A good play school can help a child make friends and be comfortable in the company of others apart from parents.What is most imp for your child to know is that you are there for her. And that you will come back to pick her. Once she feels secure she will be ok"}
{"prompt":"Hi Harpreet,üòÄ I've started following your channel very recently after it popped up as a suggestion while scrolling. I am glad that it showed up!üòÉ because I really like the way you are sharing your thoughts, analysis of child behavior patterns and also sharing important parenting tips in detail which are much needed for this gen working parents. I'm conciosuly trying my best to inclucate Montenssori method of teaching and raising a chid with gentle and respectful parenting. Din't know how simple and effetive these methods are in raising an independent and empathetic generation. Though very exhausting compared to traditional parenting method we were brought up with, it's very rewarding as it's scientific and extremely respectful way of treating another individual. Thank you soo much ‚ù§Ô∏èfor making time to share your knowledge on this platform to help us new gen parents stay more educated on these topics! üòáon a side note, I keep getting asked questions many times by my family and friends to justify the parenting style I'm trying to follow and insisting them also to practice, and without thorough research and understanding myself I feel it hard to be convinced to implement any practice.one such is kid hitting and I have understood how yelling or scolding the child for hitting doesn't help in their growth and informing them that it's hurting others, giving them options to use their hands for other activities than hitting, taking them to safe space , giving them time to calm down etc.. slowly has actually helped in making my child to hit less.. but the question I got back is \" how do you handle when your child gets hit by some other child at school? how will you prevent it? by making him all empathetic and gentle won't he be too sensitive? shoudl he not hit back if someone is bullying him or hitting him?\" can you please help me in getting answers to these. I've tried searching but not got any solid answers yet. If you already have reels on this, can you please share it or any other links anytime you are free .. it'd be very helpful ! üòá","completion":"Nandhitha - thank you for your message.

Adults (teachers etc) can be involved as wellüëç\n\nA loving child is not a sensitive child.

{"prompt":"Hello. I like your content on parenting. It‚Äôs feels very honest and not off the mill type of parenting tips we are seeing all over the Internet.I‚Äôm going through a tough time in my life. I will be divorcing my covert narcissistic husband of 11 years. I‚Äôm at loss at how I will handle my soon to be 7 year old daughter. How I will break the news to her.?How I will answer her qs ?She is too young to understand in what way her father is not good for us and I don‚Äôt want to burden her with things which are beyond her understanding.She has a very strong sense of what a family should be like even though I have a strong support system from my parents.The normal rule of thumb that one should never speak bad about your ex husband / both parents should sit down and talk with your child about the divorce usually doesn‚Äôt work in cases when one parent is toxic and doesn‚Äôt seem quite interested in being in the child‚Äôs life other than for the sole reason of social image.I know you haven‚Äôt covered parenting in abnormal situations in your blog yet. But maybe in your research if you can find any solution, it will be of great help to me.I have been reading books, messaging therapists. But haven‚Äôt find any solution yet.Thanks for reading through such a long msg. So far I have thought of telling her that her father will be staying at her grandparents house to take care of them bcz they are old and a bit sick.But it‚Äôs a lie. And maybe it‚Äôs a type of gaslighting ( to which I had been subjected to for 11 years ) which I don‚Äôt want to do to my child.

Maybe.","completion":"thank you for writing your heart outYou are already thinking, doing so much for your child.Each child is different. Their attachment to parents is different.

(or you can give a simple reason here)You can still meet him when you like. And I will always be here for youKids can sense anxiety. So the key part for you is to be comfortable with your own decision. When she sees her mother comfortable, it could be easier for herAnother thing you could do is educate her about different types of families in the world. 2 girls raising a kid, 2 boys, you can see Modern Family show where 2 fathers are raising a kid.But lead from there.

{"prompt":"To begin with , I love watching your content , having an seven year old daughter , I resonate with each and every video you make.\nI recently saw the video on schools, much against my wishes , my in laws and my husband put my daughter in Kendriya Vidyalaya. I have studied in a reputed ICSE boarding school and my heart sinks when I see my daughter going to KV as I feel peers matter and for the sheer reason that I want my child to have better than what I had.\nPros of KV : inclusive environment , children with specials needs are also a part of the same classroom.\nEquality : all students are treated equal , no special treatment to any officers child\nImportance given to sports and the down to earth environment, such as eating lunch in the playground etc.\nCons : communication skills , not very modern ways of teaching , and may be the kind of peers I grew up with , I learnt a lot of mannerisms and habits, I don't see that in this environment.\nWhat's your say ? Am I wrong?","completion":"Hi Nishka, you have very nicely described the pros and cons.Wrong and right are perceptions. What you are choosing is an environment for your child.

Small kids can't sit and eat so he might just roam around. And may be eat and may be not eat- you can put some healthy food at his eye level so that he can pick anytime and take it - fruits etc- ensure that he does not get junk food later if he asks- finally involve him in the process of cooking, cutting (wooden knife etc)And trust his animal instinct. We are animals, we will eat when we are hungry. There is no way to go without it. Don't let your anxiety of mera beta nahin kha raha come into pictureand don't use mobile/TV :-)"}
{"prompt":"As a curious parent just reaching out for some help, my daughter will turn 4 next month - she is completely potty trained but of late she has been wetting herself be it during the day at home or outside even at night. After talking to her she says she is scared but I fail to understand the reason of being scared to say she wants to use the washroom. Would love to hear back if any suggestions/opinions/answer","completion":"Hi Romayne - \n\nThank you for writing. One good information to have would have been - has there been any change of routine for your child?\n\nBut here are a few reasons I can think of.\nsometimes girl children get UTI which makes it difficult to control pee\nor there is pain happening while peeing so they control it till they no longer can\nyou could get it checked with a doctor\n\nsecond could be that the reason is emotional which is high probability coz she says she is scared. The reason this happens is generally if there has been a change in routine. Like you have started going to work or she saw a movie which was scary or if she has been ill or someone close has been ill, there is a new school or nanny.\n\nThe key part is this: being potty trained is not about making a mess or not. It is a way for a child to feel confident that this is my body, I can control it. So what is imp is that you or noone else makes her feel that there is a problem. \n\nLike 'Arey beta, why are you doing this, you were potty trained, then now why this'. This means you are pointing a fault in her. \n\nIf incident happens you can just calmly help her. And for the things she is scared you can go with her. If the reason is emotional then as she becomes more comfortable with the new order it will go away on its own once she gets used to the new routine"}

Please help me how can I make my son understand that he has to play within his limits.","completion":"Well your child wants to play that‚Äôs great actually!He is not looking to go see more tv mobile but actually play! A few things that come to my mind - I wish parents would leave kids alone to solve this.

And sometimes others don‚Äôt want to play, right. He nodsHow does that make you feelAngryI understandI understand you want to play so badly. But we will not use our hands and feetWe will not use our hands and feet. Anothe replace to do this conversation is just before he is going to play with his friends. Also you can find him alternate ways to spend energy, outdoor play etc. Other friends who have more energyYour child is fantastic! He just wants to play :-) You only have to help him express his feelings better. And all of this is assuming that his mobile time, screen time is <30 min a day.

It's a small school but it is till grade 6. Grade 4 for eg has 4 kids. I spoke to the founder of the school and had a discussion. My idea was to understand if she understands children, which she did better than me. So I put my daughter in the school. Along with that walking into the environment had a positive feeling with the way it was laid out. It was bright, clean, big windows with light streaming in. So both of them combined. If you read a bit on Montessori then you will be able to understand better. For e.g. you could pick one of the following books Montessori method (first two chapters are hard), Discovery of childhood or Secret of childhood - read chapter 4 and 5. Also imp to note that there are schools which say Montessori but don't teach that well, and there are normal board schools where the principal is great and she ensures love for learning is inculcated in kids despite the board."}

{"prompt":"My 4year daughter is not able to identify colour. Even after telling 10 times it is yellow colour she would say orange colour. What should I do","completion":"Hi Chhaya, First of all don't worry :-)You don't need to ask her 10 times. She need not feel that because she sees the world differently than you, she is lesser than othersAll of us see the world differentlyIt is possible that she is colour vision deficient. And that's ok.You can do the below test. Please read and see---To give yourself a basic indication of whether there might be a problem with your child‚Äôs colour vision, get a sheet of white paper and a basic set of colouring pencils ‚Äì at least 12 different colours but including green, red, brown, orange, blue, purple and grey. Use mid-range shades, not too pale or too dark‚Äì and shade an area of about 2cm by 2cm of each colour onto the paper. Make sure that the colours are in random order and that you don‚Äôt have all the reds or greens together, but do place red, green and brown adjacent to each other. Take the paper and your child to an area with good natural light (but not a bright light, artificial light or strong sunlight) and make up a fun game which involves asking your child to identify all of the colours on the sheet. Do not show them each colour individually, they must be able to see all of the colours at the same time.If your child shows signs that they are not sure whether a colour is red, green, brown, purple, blue or grey, there is a reasonable chance that they are red/green colour blind. Before you start ask them which colours are the easiest for them to identify. You should expect a red/green colour-blind child to be able to identify bright blue and yellow (they can identify these colours by brightness and shade). Make sure you include these colours so that they do not get the impression that they aren‚Äôt clever enough for the game. Just do this once with love. And share back. Again don't make your child feel that just because she sees the world differently something is wrong with her!"}
